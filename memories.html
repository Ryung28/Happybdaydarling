                            Happy, Happy Birthday to the most incredible person in my life, Devine Grace Sumaplong. Wow, full name! I just had to say it all because a name that beautiful deserves to be said in full. Every single day I get to spend with you, even just through chats and calls, feels like a gift. But today is different. Today is all about you, and I wanted to do everything I could to make you feel as cherished, as loved, and as celebrated as you truly are. Happy birthday, darling 🎂🎊❤️.
                        </p>

                            So, time check, it's currently 9:15 PM here, and I've been sitting in front of my screen, making this little website just for you for the past few hours. You might ask why, and the simplest answer is wala lng, I just really, really wanted to surprise you on your special day. Mu tawag unta ko nimo kay lagi molakaw naka ugma in English, I wanted to use this time to have one last long chika night with you since molakaw naka tomorrow hahahah and maybe 31 paka makauli. A part of me really wanted to spend these few hours just hearing your voice, but I knew I had to finish this. Humanon sa nako ni kay since you're special, you deserve to be treated as someone truly special, baby.I wanted to give you something you could keep, something that would remind you of how I feel, even when we can't talk.
                        </p>
                        <p class="message-text">
                            So, to start this long birthday greeting, I wanted you to know, darling, that you are genuinely one of the best things that has ever happened to my life. I know some people might call this OA, and some might even call it cringe, but I don't care about any of that because this is exactly what I feel, raw and unfiltered wow deep words hahahah. God knows best how much I love you, and I promise you I will cherish and enjoy every single moment I have with you, darling. You are, without a doubt, the most wonderful woman I have ever met. I'm not exaggerating, and you know I'm not the best with words, darling, kaya I'll just try my best to tell you everything that I feel about you.
                        </p>
                        <p class="message-text">

                        </p>
                        <p class="message-text">
                            And darling, kabalo baka your literally one of a kind. In a world where so many people are just following trends, you stand out so effortlessly. You are a high-value woman, and that is so incredibly rare nowadays. It's not just one thing; it's everything about you. You have a mindset that not everyone in this generation possesses. It's a mindset of strength, of knowing your worth, and of looking at the world with such a unique and intelligent perspective.
                        </p>
                        <p class="message-text">
                            Personality-wise, you are pure joy. Grabi ko ka happy kuyog, ambt ngano, basin sa vibe nimo. Being around you feels like stepping into the sunshine. Your energy is infectious. You're so friendly sa tanan... except nako sa school sauna, dli ko nimo pansinon! Like oh my god, am I really that disgusting? Hahaha char. But seriously, your vibe is so different and so refreshing. You are so much fun to be with, and you have this incredibly positive attitude that feels like an actual anti-depressant wowowow super deep words hahahah. You make the world feel lighter just by being in it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="message-text">
                            Beyond that, you are so responsible and hardworking. As in, kabalo jd ko hago kaayu mag working student, darling, and yet you handle it with so much grace. I see how much effort you put into everything, how you're balancing so many things at once, and yet here you are, almost graduating na. I am so, so incredibly proud of you, darling. Bisag kadyut rata nagkaila, I'm still so genuinely proud of everything you are and everything you're achieving. And you're so independent, wow. Bantay kung naa kay kuhaon mga gamit or pagkaon ba or unsa sa ref kuhaon nako tanan banko Bantay dika mangayo tabang nako hahahahah. Btaw Your independence is one of the things I admire most about you, but I also want you to know that I want to be the person you can depend on whenever you need it. You're perfect, darling. You truly are.
                        </p>
                        <p class="message-text">
                            Now, appearance-wise... hot damn, baby. If there was a scale for beauty, you would completely break it. Gwapa kayka send pic lagi darling huhuhuh 🥲 hahahah, promise. I hope you always see yourself the way I see you. Please embrace your beauty, darling. It's a kind of beauty that can literally glue my eyes for hours without me even noticing. But it's more than just that. Being with you gives me a sense of peace that I've been searching for. It's a calm that settles over me just by being in your presence. And your cuteness is completely off the charts. I always want to pinch your cheeks, it's like you're a cat. You really do give off the feeling of a cat—independent and majestic, but also so incredibly cute and comforting.
                        </p>
                        <p class="message-text">
                            So, enough about that for a second. I really, really want to thank you for everything, darling. Basin makaingon ka ngano mag thank you mn ko. It's because just you existing in my life is already a blessing that I can't even begin to describe. Btaw, I sometimes imagine, what if wala nako ni-chat nimo? What if dli sab ko brave what if no stop ko chat, or what if wala nako mo-reply nimo that one time? Moabot kaha ta ing-ani? It's a scary thought. My life would be so much less colorful without you in it. M.U. na man ata ta, wala label kay wala pa nabutngan hahahah.
